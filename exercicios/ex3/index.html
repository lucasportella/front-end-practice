    <pre>
        I'm tired of being what you want me to be
        Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
        Don't know what you're expecting of me
        Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
        Every step that I take is another mistake to you
        (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
        I've become so numb
        I can't feel you there
        Become so tired
        So much more aware
        I'm becoming this
        All I want to do
        Is be more like me
        And be less like you
        Can't you see that you're smothering me
        Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
        'Cause everything that you thought I would be
        Has fallen apart right in front of you
        Every step that I take is another mistake to you
        (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
        And every second I waste is more than I can take
        I've become so numb…
